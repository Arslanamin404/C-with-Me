Between Selection sort and Bubble sort, Selection sort is generally considered most efficient.
In terms of performance selection sort is generally prefered over bubble sort because it typically requires fewer swaps.
However its important to note that both of them are not efficient sorting algorithms especially for larger lists.

Among Selection sort, Bubble sort and Insertion sort, Insertion sort is generally considered most efficient in terms of average cases and more efficient while dealing with parially sorted or nearly sorted data sets.
