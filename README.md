# **C-with-Me** ----> Mohammad Arsalan Rather

Welcome to this C Language Programming repository on GitHub! This repository is a collection of programs, projects, and exercises that 
I have practiced and learned while exploring the C programming language.

- ## Programs:
Inside this repository, you will find a diverse range of programs that cover various aspects of C programming.
These programs are designed to help you understand fundamental concepts, such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, 
and file handling. Additionally, you will find more advanced topics like pointers, arrays, structures, and dynamic memory allocation.
Each program is accompanied by detailed comments and explanations to provide a clear understanding of the code.

- ## Projects:
This repository also includes several C language projects that demonstrate how to apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios.
**This repository is an ongoing project, and I am planing to upload more programs to expand its content. As it is a live repository,
it is not fully complete yet, and I will be adding new programs oftenly to enhance the learning experience. 
Stay tuned for updates and new additions to further enhance your C programming skills.**

- ## Contributions:
As a community-driven repository, I encourage you to contribute to the development of this project. If you have a program or a project
you'd like to share with others, feel free to submit a pull request. By collaborating with other programmers, we can create an 
extensive collection of C language programs and projects that benefit the programming community as a whole.
