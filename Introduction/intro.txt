#INTRODUCTION TO C LANGUAGE 
C language is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is a procedural language that has been widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application programming. 
C language is a structured language that provides low-level access to computer memory and has features for high-level programming as well. 
  
#**Features of C language:**
  
 Portability: C programs can be compiled and executed on different platforms with minimal changes. 
 Efficiency: C language provides direct access to system resources, allowing for efficient programming. 
 Modularity: C language provides modularity through functions, allowing for better organization of code. 
 Low-level programming: C language provides access to low-level memory manipulation, making it useful for system programming. 
 Easy to learn: C language has a simple syntax and a relatively small set of keywords, making it easy to learn for beginners. 
 Structure of a C program: 
 A C program is composed of a set of functions. The main function is the entry point of the program and is executed first. Other functions are called from the main function or from other functions.
A C program also includes preprocessor directives, variables, and statements. 
  
 Life cycle of a C program: 
 Preprocessing: The preprocessor reads the source code and performs textual substitutions based on preprocessor directives. 
 Compilation: The compiler reads the preprocessed source code and generates object code. 
 Linking: The linker combines the object code with library code to create an executable program. 
 Execution: The operating system loads the executable program into memory and executes it.


Data types and variables are important concepts in programming that help us store and manipulate data in a program. 
  
 A variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that can hold a value. Think of it as a container where we can store and retrieve data. For example, we can create a variable called "age" to store someone's age. 
  
 A constant is a value that cannot be changed once it is defined. Think of it as a fixed value that we can use throughout the program. For example, we can define a constant called "PI" to represent the mathematical constant pi. 
  
 Keywords are reserved words in C language that have a specific meaning and cannot be used as variable names or other identifiers in the program. Examples of keywords include "if", "else", "for", "while", and "int".


Operators and expressions are important concepts in programming that allow us to perform various operations and calculations in a program. 
  
 An operator is a symbol that represents a specific operation, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/). 
  
 Unary operators operate on a single operand, such as the unary minus (-) operator which changes the sign of a number. 
  
 Arithmetic operators are used for mathematical operations, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). 
  
 Logical operators are used to perform logical operations, such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!). 
  
 Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations, such as AND (&), OR (|), and XOR (^). 
  
 Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable, such as the equals (=) operator which assigns a value to a variable. 
  
 Ternary operator is a conditional operator that takes three operands and evaluates a condition. For example, the ternary operator (condition ? expression1 : expression2) can be used to assign a value to a variable based on a condition. 
  
 An expression is a combination of variables, constants, and operators that produces a value. For example, the expression "a + b" uses the variables "a" and "b" and the addition operator (+) to produce a value. 
  
 In summary, operators and expressions allow us to perform various operations and calculations in a program, including unary, arithmetic, logical, bitwise, assignment, and ternary operators. Expressions are combinations of variables, constants, and operators that produce a value
